# RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data, making them suitable for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series prediction. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs possess connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to maintain a memory of past inputs.

In RNN architectures, each input is processed sequentially, with each step incorporating information from the current input and the previous time step's hidden state. This recurrent structure enables RNNs to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in data over time.

However, standard RNNs can struggle with capturing long-term dependencies due to vanishing or exploding gradient problems during training. To address this, variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were introduced. These variants incorporate mechanisms to selectively retain or forget information, enhancing the model's ability to learn and remember over longer sequences.

RNNs have proven effective in various applications, including natural language processing tasks like language translation and sentiment analysis, where understanding context across sequences is crucial for accurate predictions.
